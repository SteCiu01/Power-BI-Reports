A curated collection of my Power BI projects, developed primarily through data challenges I’ve participated in, though not limited to them. These personal projects motivated me to explore innovative ways to stretch Power BI's capabilities to their limits.

In many of the projects' descriptions I include links, codes and tutorials so everyone can ideally try to replicate my development techniques. 

## Reports from Data Challenges

The challenges I took part are organised by Maven Analytics, my favourite analytical learning platform, with a great online community. Here the link to my [Analytical Profile](https://mavenshowcase.com/profile/681173b0-8011-704e-bdb5-614cd4fd011e) on their page, with my official entries for their challenges.

## My Other Personal Projects

During the post-pandemic time there has been a peack of inflation, and rather in that time I started to invest consistently. Therefore, I came up with the idea to create two Power BI reports, one to track the cost of living in different countries and cities over time (to monitor the inflation) and the other one as platform to get better insights on my investments (as I didn't fully like the UI of the Bank App I was using). 

That's how I created:

| Project | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| 🌐 Global Cost of Living Report | Cost of living across countries and cities over time | [View Project](https://github.com/SteCiu01/Power-BI-Reports/blob/main/Global-Cost-of-Living/README.md) |
| 📈 My Money Manager Pro Tool | A platform designed to track personal investment insights | [View Project](https://github.com/SteCiu01/Power-BI-Reports/blob/main/Money-Manager-Pro/README.md) |

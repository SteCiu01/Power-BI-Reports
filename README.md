Collection of my projects, primarily (but not only) from data challenges I participated in. These personal projects motivated me to explore innovative ways to stretch Power BI's capabilities to their limits.

The challenges I took part are organised by Maven Analytics, my favourite analytical learning platform, with a great online community. Here the link to my [Analytical Portfolio](https://mavenshowcase.com/profile/681173b0-8011-704e-bdb5-614cd4fd011e) on their page with my official entries for their challenges.

In the projects' descriptions I include links, codes and tutorials so everyone can ideally try to replicate my development techniques.
